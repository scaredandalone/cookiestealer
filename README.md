## About
This project is a conceptual implementation of a cookie extraction and exfiltration tool designed to explore the security risks associated with browser cookie storage and transmission. The script demonstrates how cookies can be decrypted from Google Chrome using its local encryption key and sent to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.  

By understanding the vulnerabilities illustrated in this tool, developers and security professionals can take steps to better secure sensitive data in their applications.  

### How It Works
The script accesses Chrome's cookie storage database and decrypts encrypted cookie values using the AES key stored in the browser's Local State file. Once decrypted, the cookie data is sent to a server for further processing. To facilitate testing or proof-of-concept demonstrations, a tunnel (such as Cloudflare Tunnel) can be used to expose a local server to the internet securely.  

### Limitations and Detection
The project highlights some critical limitations and detection challenges:
1. Antivirus software or endpoint protection tools may flag scripts like this due to their behavior (e.g., accessing browser files, sending HTTP requests).  
2. Network monitoring systems can detect and block the exfiltration of sensitive data over HTTP, especially if transmitted unencrypted.  
3. Accessing Chrome's data requires certain user permissions, and active browser processes may lock essential files, preventing extraction.

### Potential Enhancements
1. While this script is designed as a straightforward proof of concept, real-world adversaries often employ techniques like enhanced obfuscation, encrypted transmission, dynamic server URLs, and multi-browser compatibility to evade detection.  
2. Integrating features such as encrypted data transmission or dynamic server resolution would make the tool more resilient against monitoring systems but also emphasize the importance of secure practices to prevent misuse.  
3. Added support for different types of browsers.
